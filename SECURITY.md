# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Until tagged releases exist, `main` is the only supported branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please **do not** open a public issue for sensitive vulnerabilities.

Instead, email: `security@example.com` (replace with real contact) including:
- Affected component / path
- Impact & exploit scenario
- Reproduction steps or PoC
- Suggested remediation (if any)

We aim to acknowledge within 72 hours and provide an initial assessment within 7 days.

## Scope
- Code execution / injection
- Sensitive data exposure
- Authentication / authorization flaws (future when auth is added)
- Supply chain / dependency risk

## Out of Scope (unless high-impact chaining)
- DoS via excessive well‑formed requests
- Theoretical issues with no realistic exploit path

## Coordinated Disclosure
We appreciate responsible disclosure. We'll credit reporters in release notes unless anonymity requested.
